# Bootcamp lab1

## Objective
Get you started!

## Step 1 - cluster formation

Try to run three JVMs with each of the config options "__none__", "__java__", "__xml__" or "__standalone__"
on the command line.

eg. *java -jar target/bootcamp-lab1-server.jar xml*

Try to run JVMs mixing the config options, to see what happens.

## Step 2 - data operations
Use the XML option, as this configures maps to have different numbers of backups.

From any or all of the JVMs, try the command options to put data in maps, queues, topics and atomic
counters.

## Step 3 - resilience
Kill one of the JVMs from step 2. Try the "*list*" command to see what has happened to the data.

Restart that JVM. Use "*quit*" to close a different JVM. What has happened to the data ?

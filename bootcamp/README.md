# Bootcamp
A lot in a short time, with an intense focus. Concepts, practical advice and hands-on coding.

Build and run your first cluster on your laptop, then a whistle-stop tour of the essentials.

No previous Hazelcast experience required.

Should use Java 8, and an IDE such as Eclipse or Intellij.

The examples are in Maven, but would not be difficult to convert to Gradle. Gradle users usually can figure out Maven, less frequently the reverse.

## NOTE 1
Maven builds executable Jar files, so you need to run as far as the _package_ phase. So try "*mvn install*".

## Note 2
A lot, but not enough time for everything.
